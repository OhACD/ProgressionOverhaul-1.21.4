Welcome to Progression Overhaul
Survival just got deeper, more deliberate, and a little more dangerous.

💤 Watch Your Fatigue
Working too hard — mining, fighting, crafting — will wear you down.

Rest at beds or warm up by campfires to recover.

High fatigue slows you and blurs your vision; low fatigue gives you a burst of speed and haste.

🛠 Craft with What You Find
Gather Pebbles and Plant Fibers from the wild to make your first tools.

Axes can strip logs, sometimes giving you bark — a handy fuel.

Discover Smithing Templates to upgrade chainmail into iron armor.

🔥 Master the Clay Furnace
Smelt raw iron and gold using simple fuels: logs, sticks, or bark.

Track your smelting progress with its custom interface.

📍 Explore the World
Certain places — villages, campfires, landmarks — can change your stats or trigger special events (more coming in future updates).

Keep an eye out for new crafting boosts tied to where you are.

🏆 Earn Advancements
Challenges reward you for mastering new systems, from pebble crafting to smelting your first ingots.

Tip: Early on, balance your time between gathering, crafting, and resting — pushing too hard will slow you down when it matters most.
