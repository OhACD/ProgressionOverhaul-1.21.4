🌱 Point of Humanity – v0.1.0: Foundations of Survival
🔨 Reworked Early Progression
Removed Stone Sword – no more quick leap to power

Stone Tools require String or Plant Fiber to craft

Wooden Sword rebalanced for reduced early-game strength

Mining without tools is now slower, rewarding progression

🌿 New Resources
Pebbles now drop from dirt, grass, and mud

Sharp Stone can be crafted from Pebbles and used as a primitive blade

Cobblestone ⇄ Pebbles crafting loop introduced

Plant Fiber added – gathered from grass and used in early tool recipes

🪨 Smarter Block Drops
Iron Ore behavior split:

Drops Raw Iron when mined with sub-iron tools

Drops itself when mined with iron-tier or better tools

Dirt Clumps added – drop from dirt variants with weak tools and can be crafted into dirt blocks

🧱 Crafting System Tweaks
Furnace removed to slow technological acceleration

Chainmail Armor is now craftable using Chains

Chains are now craftable from 3 iron nuggets
